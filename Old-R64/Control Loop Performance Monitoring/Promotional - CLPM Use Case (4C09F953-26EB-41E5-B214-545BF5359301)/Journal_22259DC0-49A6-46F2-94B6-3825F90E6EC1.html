<p>Level controllers are typically designed to absorb fluctuations and disturbances to maintain process stability.  It is often acceptable for a tank level PV to vary, as long as it is not at risk of exceeding an upper or lower limit.  As such, metrics commonly used in CLPM, such as AAE, are less relevant in monitoring level controllers.</p><p>In addition to the CO Travel and Controller Mode metrics already discussed, the proximity of a tank level to its limits is another metric that may be used.  To calculate this metric, it is important to have the<a href="/links?type&#61;workstep&amp;workbook&#61;4C09F953-26EB-41E5-B214-545BF5359301&amp;worksheet&#61;22259DC0-49A6-46F2-94B6-3825F90E6EC1&amp;workstep&#61;27DD05CA-EB14-4CC2-98D0-01773AE7B335" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> tank level limits, in addition to the other controller tags</a><a href="/links?type&#61;workstep&amp;workbook&#61;4C09F953-26EB-41E5-B214-545BF5359301&amp;worksheet&#61;22259DC0-49A6-46F2-94B6-3825F90E6EC1&amp;workstep&#61;E40BE442-D76D-4669-BFBD-C9D438808F9F" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">.</a></p><p><a href="/links?type&#61;workstep&amp;workbook&#61;4C09F953-26EB-41E5-B214-545BF5359301&amp;worksheet&#61;22259DC0-49A6-46F2-94B6-3825F90E6EC1&amp;workstep&#61;B96AB985-A3D5-4ADE-9E49-19D0B0EA9022" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Value Sear</a>ch <a href="/links?type&#61;workstep&amp;workbook&#61;4C09F953-26EB-41E5-B214-545BF5359301&amp;worksheet&#61;22259DC0-49A6-46F2-94B6-3825F90E6EC1&amp;workstep&#61;B96AB985-A3D5-4ADE-9E49-19D0B0EA9022" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">c</a>an be used to identify when a hi or lo level limit is exceeded.  However, monitoring how close a tank level is to its limits over time can help identify when performance is changing and warn engineers/ operators that a tank is at risk of exceeding limits before it does so.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
