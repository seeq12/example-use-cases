<p>Often times, the same controller is used for different product recipes.  When this occurs, performance is different between one recipe to the next.  Therefore, it is important to be able identify these different conditions or recipes so that condition based metric limits can be established.</p><p>In this example, PIC-002 is used for 3 different recipes: Recipe A, Recipe B and Recipe C.  <a href="/links?type&#61;workstep&amp;workbook&#61;4C09F953-26EB-41E5-B214-545BF5359301&amp;worksheet&#61;4B9427E2-FA62-4444-ABDF-0194AB051AC7&amp;workstep&#61;DE4B8C43-5374-4A36-938B-A4CD6946CFE9" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Conditions are created to identify when the process is operating in each of these conditions.</a></p><p>Now that the different conditions or recipes are identified, limits for each recipe are calculated and spliced together to <a href="/links?type&#61;workstep&amp;workbook&#61;4C09F953-26EB-41E5-B214-545BF5359301&amp;worksheet&#61;4B9427E2-FA62-4444-ABDF-0194AB051AC7&amp;workstep&#61;BA5D56CE-12F1-495B-BBFE-4B5FB020DC8F" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">display as a single limit</a>.</p><p>Finally, <a href="/links?type&#61;workstep&amp;workbook&#61;4C09F953-26EB-41E5-B214-545BF5359301&amp;worksheet&#61;4B9427E2-FA62-4444-ABDF-0194AB051AC7&amp;workstep&#61;5F8DD0A0-D858-4F46-88FE-9458198947E2" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Value </a>Search can be used to identify when the process is outside of the recipe based limits.</p><p> </p><p>**NOTE: current off-the-shelf CLPM solutions do not have a way to analyze a loop&#39;s performance based on mode of operation or recipe.</p><p> </p>
