<h2><strong>Run Length Optimization</strong></h2><h4><strong>Background: </strong></h4><h4>Many manufacturing units hit process throughput constraints over the course of a run. These constraints are often reversible, but at the cost of shutting down to clean/maintain equipment. Sometimes the decision to shutdown and clean equipment, regaining throughput rate upon start-up, enables a unit to meet their production goals sooner. Meeting targets sooner translates into more production (&amp; $$) over time. </h4><h4><strong>Scenario:</strong> </h4><h4>A manufacturing production unit needs to produce 50,000 klb of the product that they are running. The supply chain for this product is tight and the customer needs the full order filled ASAP. </h4><h4>The production rate for this product decreases at a relatively constant linear rate due to equipment fouling and plugging constraints. A 12-hour shutdown (production rate &#61; 0 klb/h) can be taken at any point during a product run in order to recover production rate. </h4><p><strong>Data:</strong></p><p><a href="/links?type&#61;signal&amp;item&#61;9F386D8E-867F-408B-857A-6BC8E8E11AB6" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Production Rate</a></p><p><a href="/links?type&#61;metric&amp;item&#61;41176384-267B-4636-A2CE-211C72344F14" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Recovered Production Rate</a></p><p><strong>Date Range:</strong></p><ul><li>1Q 2020 </li></ul><h3><strong>Challenge Instructions:</strong></h3><ol><li>Duplicate this master workbench and change the name to &#34;April 2020 Use Case Challenge - YOUR NAME&#34;.</li><li>Create a new worksheet for your solution.
